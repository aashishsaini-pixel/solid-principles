Liskov's Substitution Principle



--> The principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 and according to this principle
 "Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes".
 This principle ensures that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place
  of its parent without any unexpected behaviour.
